										The position includes, developing online retail sites using progressive technologies and serverless architectures within a team environment. 
										I would value the opportunity to take part in web development projects, to contribute and observe as the project grows from planning to deployment. 
										I would be interested to learn what goes into developing and maintaining retail websites and explore the other areas of eCommerce. 
										Becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer is attractive to me as I am a creative spirit but also have a great curiosity to understand how things work.

										The position requires experience working with Linux and version control software such as git. 
										It specifies experience with web design tools such as: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
										It also requires experience with NodeJS; a server environment, Nginx; a web and proxy server, and MySQL; a database service.
										<br>The advertisement also outlines familiarity with PHP, TypeScript, JavaScript libraries and frameworks, container environments, cloud services, eCommerce platforms, further database systems and IDEs.
										<br>Although there is much experience required, the advertisement does not specify a timeframe. I would presume an attractive applicant would have a minimum of 5 years of experience working in the field.

							I am confident with working on Linux and the terminal. 
							I have dabbled in learning JavaScript with the Grasshopper app on my phone. 
							I had been previously introduced to HTML and CSS during my media studies, but I am now delving further into learning the tools. 
							I have also come across GitHub repositories a few times in the past and managed to compile a few programs. 
							Now I am beginning to become familiar with using GitHub for developing projects. 
							This is a very ambitious career goal for me. 
							I have much <font size="+2">much</font> <font size="+3">much!</font> to learn and many years of experience ahead of me in order to pursue this career.
						</p>
						<p>
							To begin my path into this career, I would need to become more familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and develop these skills into an advanced understanding. 
							I would need to become proficient with using GitHub and collaborating within teams. 
							I would need to practice my skills and develop a portfolio. 
							I would also need to learn about front-end frameworks, 
							TypeScript and the more advanced tools and technologies such as, NodeJS, MySQL and APIs. 
							I hope that furthering my education through a bachelor of IT would help me to gain the skills and knowledge I need and expose me to the more advanced tools and technologies a full-stack JavaScript developer needs.
