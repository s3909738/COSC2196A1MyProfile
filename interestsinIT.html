									<p>
										I have interests in IT relating to computers, programming, game design, the Internet of Things, the Raspberry Pi and other SOC technologies. 
										Being a creative minded person, I have always been fascinated with how IT applications can be used to customise and personalize interfaces and user experiences, as well as automate and simplify tasks. 
										I have used graphics software to make icons and learned how to make my own Star Trek themed boot screen with the Grub2 boot loader.
									</p>
									<p>
										I enjoy learning about the history of technological development and advances, and playing around with old, obsolete technology and programs. 
										For instance, I explored using DOS 6.22 while reading <i>"Special Edition Using MS-DOS® 6.22, Third Edition"</i> by Jim Cooper, becoming familiar with batch files and command line programs. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Playing the <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> games on the PlayStation platform sparked and interest in programming and game design. 
										With <i>LittleBigPlanet 2</i> introducing me to logic gates. 
										I would use the level creation to play around with logic and build all sorts of contraptions to use in levels. 
										Some projects included: building a walking robot, building an interactive piano and I created a duck hunt game using motion controls. 
										I enjoyed using the level creation tools to come up with solutions within my level designs.
									</p>
									<p>
										Most of my IT knowledge and experience comes from my own research, learning projects and hands on exploration with computers and technology. 
										Creating a custom boot screen on my computer took a lot of research into dual boot systems, the Linux and Windows operating systems and the Grub2 bootloader. 
										I have also dabbled in learning program languages such as Basic, C++ and Java.
									</p>
									<p>
										I have been interested to further my education for a while now. working a fulltime job, I have felt trapped, limited with options to further my education and career. 
										Entering into my 30’s has provided a good push to pursue my long-term goals. 
										I chose to study at RMIT as they provide the course I intended to study in an online format, which will allow me to keep my work commitments while I study.
									</p>
									<p>
										I hope studying this course will prepare me for entering study into bachelor of IT. 
										I hope to learn more about different IT industries and IT applications. 
										Learn about tools and programs used in the industry and develop my collaboration skills. 
										I would be particularly interested in learning more about the development of mobile technologies within the home and the workplace.
