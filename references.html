									<p>I am from Ballarat Victoria (AEST) and currently working full-time as a Fruit and Veg 2IC in a supermarket.
									I was born in Australia and English is my first language. I completed year 12 VCE with a Cert III in Media in 2009 and enrolled into Cert IV of Applied Fashion Design and Technology at The Gordon TAFE in Geelong.
									Unfortunately, I did not complete the course due to personal reasons at the time, which has become a painful regret as I would have liked to pursue a career as a pattern drafter.
									Being in the workforce for nearly 10 years now has taught me many life lessons and I feel ready to get back into study.
									I have always had an interest in computers and technology which is why I have decided to change direction and study IT.
									I am fairly new to the field and this is my first time using HTML to build a complete website. 
									<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"><i>w3schools.com</i></a> has been <strong>super</strong> helpful!
									<br><br>I am number 8 from a family of 11 children and I was born on my older brotherâ€™s birthday.
									<br>I was the best birthday present ever!
