									<p>I Propose a project to develop a mobile application, based on the Android platform, that integrates with opensource speech recognition software that would function as a voice driven assistant to make audio journals and generate text transcripts. 
									The application would also be used as an interface to access, share and manage journals. 
									The application would feature the ability to use inline voice commands to manipulate and manage the journal data from within a recording session.
									<br>
									The project would include exploring ways to implement a simple inline voice command language that is recognised by the assistant. 
									With main inline commands aiming to give users the ability to format and insert meta data into their journals on the fly. Making it more convenient for users to access information within audio recordings and transcripts later on. 
									The application would also be used as a brainstorming tool and include the ability to insert links to google search results into journal transcripts.
									<br>
									The project would investigate enhancing the assistant with AI that can implement grammar and punctuation restoration within generated transcripts. 
									And explore cloud-based services the application could link with to upload and share journals.
									<br>
									The project could also have Potential to Investigate Implementing a web-based front end and setting up a server environment to store and manage user accounts and data.

									<p>If you haven’t already guessed, I have taken much inspiration from Star Trek, observing how the captains communicate with their ships computer to make logs.
									<br>
									With inspirational ideas easily escaping us without having the chance to write them down, many writers are migrating to using Audio journals. 
									Audio Journals are faster than writing and can help different creative types to brainstorm more freely 
									<a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/ways-writers-can-benefit-from-audio-journaling#what-is-audio-journaling">(MasterClass 2020)</a>. 
									This assistant would make recording audio journals and ideas more accessible to researchers, developers and students. At its core, the assistant simply records audio and provides a transcription. 
									But this project would also implement using verbal commands to drive the application and enhance, manipulate, transcriptions and audio recordings. 
									With the user experience being as simple or as advanced to suit their needs.

									<p>The main feature of this project would be using voice commands to control the assistant and initiate inline functions to manipulate transcripts and recorded audio as you are recording. 
									It would also include the ability to share, manage and play back journals, and read transcripts. 
									Main control commands would include:
										<ul>
											<li>“start”, “stop”, “pause” and “resume” recording functions.</li>
											<li>Being able to stop and delete the current recording.</li>
											<li>Play back journals with the ability to start from certain points within the recording.</li>
											<li>Pull up a list of timestamps within a journal.</li>
											<li>Start a “supplemental log” that amends to a previous journal</li>
											<li>Directly share journals to contacts or groups.</li>
										</ul>
									Transcript and audio manipulation functions would include:
										<ul>
											<li>Adding a journal tag that can be used to group it with related journals.</li>
											<li>Adding a heading with a time stamp before a paragraph or new topic that can be directly pulled up later without having to read through the entire transcript. This could also be used to pull up the audio from that point too.</li>
											<li>Tagging contacts and groups to your journals.</li>
											<li>Insert google search links for references and further research.</li>
											<li>Strike the previous sentence or topic paragraph, in order to start over without mucking up an entire journal.</li>
										</ul>
									Inline voice command functions could work similar to a crude form of HTML markup. 
									Using an activating key word before your instruction, to prompt the software of an incoming function. 
									An example of this structure could look like:
									</p>
									<p style="text-align:center"><b>“[key word to prompt incoming function command] – [command]-information-[/end command]”</b>
									</p>
									<p>The application would then apply the function and delete out the spoken command words from the audio recording and transcript. 
									This feature would require much brainstorming and development.
									A drawback to this feature would be relying on user investment to learn the voice activated commands, to make the most of the application. 
									But with just a basic understanding of the applications’ voice driven interface, it could still be used to make general audio journals.
									</p>
									<p>A use case scenario to demonstrate the application in action could be described as follows:
									<br>Imagine a user talking to the journal assistant.
									</p>
									<p style="line-height:1.7;">“[app prompt] start new journal” – start a new journal entry
									<br>“[app prompt] [Title] my first journal [end title]” – add a title
									<br>“[app prompt] [heading] my first experience [end heading]” – add a heading that can be jumped back to in later reading
									<br>“[app prompt] [contact] Zachary Williams [end contact]” – tag someone from your contact list
									<br>“[app prompt] [group] OUA IIT [end group]” – tag a group
									<br>“This is my first journal. I feel like a Star Fleet Captain…” – insert body content
									<br>“I am going to need to learn Java to make this app…”
									<br>“[app prompt] [research] java tutorials [end research]” – provides a google search link into the transcript
									<br>“[app prompt] [heading] further research [end heading]” – start a new paragraph and add a new heading that can be jumped back to later
									<br>“I need to research opensource speech recognition software and...”
									<br>“[app prompt] [research] opensource speech recognition software [end research]”
									<br>“[app prompt] [stop recording]” – terminate recording and save audio journal and transcript
									</p>
									<p>The [app prompt] word would need to be a unique word that isn’t going to come up in general conversation, as not to confuse the application.
									</p>
									<p>Other features of the application project would include: accessing and managing audio journals and transcripts, sharing with contacts and providing an in app notification of journals that you have been tagged in and can link to.
									</p>
									<p>Project objectives would include:
										<ul>
											<li>Brainstorm and develop ideas to implement and form a voice-controlled command language/script.</li>
											<li>Research speech recognition APIs and investigate implementation.</li>
											<li>Research and develop solutions to implement punctuation and grammar correcting AI to format transcripts.</li>
											<li>Research and develop solutions to link with a cloud service.</li>
											<li>Development of Java coding skills to build the application, that could then be implemented onto android devices.</li>
											<li>Define and implement voice-controlled commands and functions.</li>
											<li>Investigate how the application will create, manipulate and manage data.</li>
											<li>Define and implement Application GUI.</li>
											<li>Testing application throughout development.</li>

									<p>Completion of this project would aim to bring easier access to information within audio journals. 
									Providing transcripts, headings and timestamps that can be used to quickly navigate through the information, rather than having to listen through long audio sessions until you have reached the information required. 
									The application would also aim to enhance the availability of audio journals. providing a voice driven interface to request auditory information and a graphical interface for accessing transcripts. The application would also help enable the ability to share with others through inserting contact and group tags. 
									I hope that this application would contribute to sharing inspiration and ideas throughout the academic world. If successful, I would like to see this application integrated with mainstream assistant technologies such as, Google assistant and Alexa, making its way into the home and being used by people and families to share their ideas and spoken stories with one another.
